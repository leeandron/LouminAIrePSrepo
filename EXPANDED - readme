Section: Define Objectives and Scope

To define the objectives and scope of LouminAIre-PS, we need to consider its purpose and target audience. The primary objective is to create a programming language that is accessible and easy to use for individuals with a 9th Grade Reading Level and beyond. The language should promote simplicity, readability, and clarity in code.

The scope of LouminAIre-PS includes its intended applications and domains. It can be designed to support a wide range of use cases, such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. By defining the objectives and scope clearly, we provide a foundation for the subsequent stages of language design and development.

Example:

Objective: The main objective of LouminAIre-PS is to enable individuals with a 9th Grade Reading Level to learn and write code easily, thereby promoting inclusivity and accessibility in the programming community.

Scope: LouminAIre-PS will target web development, mobile app development, and data analysis domains initially. It will provide features and constructs that simplify the development process and allow users to create robust and efficient applications.

Section: Language Design

In the language design stage, we focus on defining the syntax, structure, and grammar of LouminAIre-PS. The goal is to create a language that is intuitive, concise, and consistent, ensuring ease of understanding and readability.

Example:

Syntax: LouminAIre-PS will use a simplified syntax with keywords and constructs that are easy to remember and use. For instance, instead of complex loops, it may introduce a "repeat" keyword for iterative operations. This simplification will reduce cognitive load and make the language more accessible to users with varying levels of programming experience.

Control Flow: LouminAIre-PS will provide clear and intuitive control flow structures, such as "if-else" statements for conditional branching and "for-each" loops for iterating over collections. The goal is to make the flow of code easily understandable, even for individuals new to programming.

Variable Naming: LouminAIre-PS will enforce guidelines for variable naming that promote clarity and consistency. For example, it may encourage the use of meaningful names that reflect the purpose and content of the variables, following a camel case convention (e.g., myVariable, firstName).

Section: Lexical Analysis

In the lexical analysis stage, we develop a lexer or tokenizer that breaks down the source code into tokens. These tokens represent the building blocks of the language, such as keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals.

Example:

Keywords: LouminAIre-PS will define a set of keywords that have specific meanings within the language. These keywords, such as "if," "else," "for," and "while," will be recognized by the lexer and treated as control flow or language-specific constructs.

Identifiers: LouminAIre-PS will allow users to define their own identifiers, such as variable names and function names. The lexer will identify and tokenize these identifiers, enabling the parser and other stages to process them correctly.

Literals: LouminAIre-PS will support different types of literals, including numeric literals (e.g., 42, 3.14), string literals (e.g., "Hello, World!"), and boolean literals (e.g., true, false). The lexer will recognize and tokenize these literals accordingly.

Section: Parsing

The parsing stage involves implementing a parser that generates a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens produced by the lexer. The parser validates the syntax of the code against the defined grammar rules.

Example:

Grammar Rules: LouminAIre-PS will have a well-defined grammar that specifies the valid combinations of tokens and their order. The parser will enforce these rules to ensure that the code follows the language's syntax. For instance, it will require a semicolon at the end of each statement to denote the end of an expression.

Parse Tree: The parser will generate a parse tree or AST, which represents the hierarchical structure of the code. For example, an "if-else" statement will be represented as a branch node with two child nodes representing the condition and the respective branches.

Validation: The parser will validate the code against the grammar rules and report syntax errors if any violations are found. It will provide informative error messages to help users identify and correct the syntax issues in their code.

Section: Semantic Analysis

In the semantic analysis stage, we perform checks on the parse tree or AST to ensure type compatibility, scoping rules, and other language-specific checks. This stage helps enforce semantic correctness and consistency in the code.

Example:

Type Compatibility: LouminAIre-PS will perform type checking to ensure that operations are performed on compatible data types. For example, it will prevent arithmetic operations between strings and integers or assignments of incompatible types.

Scoping Rules: LouminAIre-PS will enforce scoping rules to manage variable visibility and avoid conflicts. It will ensure that variables are declared before use and have the appropriate scope within functions or blocks.

Name Resolution: The semantic analysis stage will resolve variable names and references, ensuring that they correspond to valid declarations. It will detect and report undeclared variables or conflicting variable names.

Section: Intermediate Representation

In the intermediate representation stage, we create an intermediate representation (IR) of the code that serves as a bridge between the high-level code and the final executable code. The IR is a simplified and optimized form of code that is easier to work with for subsequent stages.

Example:

IR Generation: LouminAIre-PS will generate an intermediate representation (IR) that captures the essential semantics of the code. The IR will be a platform-independent representation that allows for further analysis and optimization.
